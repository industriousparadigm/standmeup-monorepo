# Standmeup

Welcome to Standmeup, a simple app to keep track of topics to bring up during your morning standup.

### Techy stuff

Data created by users is stored in a MongoDB database, served via a Node server and displayed using React.

Login is dealt with using Auth0.

This app is based on Auth0's own starter project.
